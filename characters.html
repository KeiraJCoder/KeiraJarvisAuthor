                                        Sophie Munday is a girl caught between two worlds—one she has always known and another she never believed existed.  
                                        Her life has been defined by <span class="emphasis">mystery, unanswered questions, and relentless nightmares</span>.  
                                        As she turns <span class="emphasis">16</span>, everything begins to change, forcing her to confront <span class="emphasis">a past hidden from her</span>.

                                        Sophie was raised by her <span class="emphasis">single mother, Jean</span>, who has always been <span class="emphasis">protective to an unusual degree</span>.  
                                        She was led to believe that her father was <span class="emphasis">a firefighter who died before she could remember him</span>.

                                        Since childhood, she has suffered from <span class="emphasis">terrifying nightmares and strange visions</span>.  
                                        She has always suspected that there is <span class="emphasis">more to her past than she has been told</span>, but <span class="emphasis">no one will give her answers</span>.

                                        Her <span class="emphasis">blood type is rare</span>, and there are <span class="emphasis">whispers of an ancient prophecy</span> that somehow involves her.

                                        Jean has kept secrets from Sophie for <span class="emphasis">her entire life</span>, but Sophie begins to <span class="emphasis">sense that something is missing</span>.

                                        Sophie becomes aware of <span class="emphasis">a presence watching her</span>, though she does not know who—or what—he is.

                                        Eden is a Vampyr with a past steeped in darkness. Once The Master's <span class="emphasis">most trusted disciple</span>,
                                        he has spent centuries attempting to atone for his past crimes. Now, with his daughter Sophie caught in
                                        the Night World’s grasp, he is forced to confront his past head-on.

                                        Eden was once The Master's <span class="emphasis">protégé</span>, trained in his ways and raised in his court of terror.
                                        He committed <span class="emphasis">countless atrocities</span> before finally breaking away. Few who have defied
                                        The Master have lived to tell the tale—Eden is one of them.

                                        Eden met <span class="emphasis">Jean Munday</span> in the late 1980s at The Ruskin Arms Pub in East Ham.
                                        Their <span class="emphasis">whirlwind romance</span> led to Jean’s pregnancy—something neither of them thought was possible.

                                        When Jean discovered <span class="emphasis">what he truly was</span>, she was horrified. She cut him out of her life
                                        and forbade him from seeing Sophie. Despite this, Eden could not stay away, secretly watching over

                                        Eden possesses <span class="emphasis">enhanced telepathy and empathy</span>, allowing him to sense emotions and sometimes hear thoughts.
                                        This ability fuels his guilt, as he can <span class="emphasis">feel the pain of those he has hurt</span>.

                                        Eden returned to Sophie’s life to protect her from The Master, who believes she is <span class="emphasis">the key to an ancient prophecy</span>.

                                        The prophecy foretells the <span class="emphasis">“Downfall of Night”</span>, but Eden does not fully understand its meaning.
                                        He only knows that The Master <span class="emphasis">collected her blood</span> to confirm she is the prophesied one.

                                    <p>
                                        Eden never expected to be part of Sophie’s life, but when they finally meet, he feels an overwhelming
                                        sense of <span class="emphasis">love and responsibility</span>. He is fiercely protective of her but fears he may not
                                        be strong enough to keep her safe from The Master.

                                    <h4>Jean Munday (Former Lover)</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Jean was <span class="emphasis">the love of his life</span>. Though he understood her decision to push him away, it left him
                                        heartbroken. He respected her choice to <span class="emphasis">raise Sophie as human</span> and never tried to take
                                        that from her.

                                        Aeryn and Eden share a <span class="emphasis">deep, unspoken bond</span> forged in blood, survival, and shared tragedy. 
                                        Their past remains largely untold, but <span class="emphasis">Eden clearly feels responsible for her fate</span>.

                                    <p>
                                        Though he rarely expresses emotion, his determination to keep her safe
                                        speaks volumes about how much she means to him.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Whether out of <span class="emphasis">duty, guilt, or something more</span>, Eden will stop at nothing to free her.

                                        The Master is the <span class="emphasis">single most terrifying figure in Eden’s past</span>.

                                        Once his most trusted follower, Eden now <span class="emphasis">actively works against him</span> while avoiding direct confrontation.

                                    She is a <span class="emphasis">skilled hunter</span>, stalking her prey with precision and taking pleasure in the kill.</p>
                                    <p>Unlike Eden, she <span class="emphasis">does not hesitate to feed</span>. She is <span class="emphasis">methodical and experienced</span>, ensuring there is <span class="emphasis">no evidence left behind</span>.  
                                    Her efficiency suggests that she has been living this way for <span class="emphasis">a long time</span>.</p>
                                    <p>She sees the Vampyr world for what it is—<span class="emphasis">a struggle for survival</span>—and while she admires Eden’s restraint, she does not share it.</p>

                                    <p>After a hunt, Aeryn mistakenly <span class="emphasis">attacks Eden</span>, thinking he is human.  
                                    He overpowers her easily, but instead of being angry, she <span class="emphasis">laughs</span>—showing that she <span class="emphasis">isn’t afraid of him</span>.</p>
                                    <p>Their tension <span class="emphasis">quickly shifts into something else</span>, and they <span class="emphasis">end up sleeping together</span>.  
                                    This is the first and only time in Book One that Eden <span class="emphasis">shows a romantic or sexual connection</span> with anyone.</p>
                                    <p>However, <span class="emphasis">Eden immediately regrets it</span>, further highlighting his <span class="emphasis">inner conflict</span> over his emotions.</p>

                                    Helping him means <span class="emphasis">betraying The Master</span>, a decision that will <span class="emphasis">turn her into a hunted outcast</span>.</p>
                                    <p>Despite this, <span class="emphasis">she does not hesitate</span>. Her loyalty to Eden outweighs her fear of the consequences.</p>
                                    <p>With a wry smile, she tells him, <span class="emphasis">“Till death do us part, Eden.”</span>

                                        Blaine is a Vampyr who appears out of nowhere, 
                                        <em>watching Sophie from the shadows</em> before making himself known.  
                                        He is <span class="emphasis">playful, teasing, and frustratingly vague</span>, never giving away too much about himself.

                                        His motives are <span class="emphasis">unclear</span>, his past <span class="emphasis">a mystery</span>, and his presence

                                        Sophie first encounters Blaine in a <span class="emphasis">graveyard</span>, where he follows her through the darkness.  
                                        He <em>doesn’t lunge, doesn’t attack</em>—he simply watches, calculating.

                                        But there is an edge beneath his charm, a <span class="emphasis">predatory awareness</span> that keeps Sophie on guard.

                                        He doesn’t immediately see her as prey, and he <span class="emphasis">tests her in ways that aren’t purely Vampyric</span>.

                                        Jean met <span class="emphasis">Eden</span> in the late 1980s at <em>The Ruskin Arms</em>, a well-known rock and metal pub in East Ham, London.  
                                        She was a rebellious free spirit, drawn to his <span class="emphasis">dangerous aura</span> and undeniable presence.

                                        Their connection was <span class="emphasis">brief but intense</span>, leading to Sophie’s conception—something neither of them believed was possible.  
                                        When Jean discovered <span class="emphasis">Eden was a Vampyr</span>, she was horrified and immediately cut him out of her life.

                                        After leaving Eden, Jean moved back in with her parents for support.  
                                        She <span class="emphasis">lied about Sophie’s father</span>, telling her daughter that he was a firefighter who died tragically.

                                        Jean <span class="emphasis">refused to let Eden have contact with Sophie</span>, believing it was the only way to keep her safe.  
                                        Eden, despite this, continued to <em>watch over Sophie in secret</em>, even appearing in her room at night.

                                        When Sophie was six, Eden told her he was her <span class="emphasis">“guardian angel”</span>,  
                                        but realizing he was getting too close, he disappeared from her life once again.

                                        An <span class="emphasis">ancient prophecy</span>, written in the first century, foretells a <em>cataclysmic event</em> that could destroy or reshape the Night World.

                                        Before his death, Clarke <span class="emphasis">passed the prophecy to Malus</span>—some believe <em>The Master killed him for it</em>.

                                        The prophecy speaks of the <span class="emphasis">“Downfall of Night”</span>, a moment in time tied to a <em>specific bloodline</em>.  
                                        <span class="emphasis">Sophie Munday’s blood</span> has confirmed her connection to this prophecy—The Master now believes she is the key to everything.

                  Jean is a mother torn between love and fear. She spent her life hiding Sophie from the Night World,
                  desperate to protect her from the dark fate written in blood and prophecy. But in <em>Wisdom</em>,
                  Jean must face her past and embrace the power she swore never to use.

                <p>
                  Jean was raised as an ordinary girl, but her father <strong>Alexander Munday</strong> revealed the truth on his deathbed:
                  - <strong>Jean is half-Witch</strong>, the daughter of a powerful, unknown mother.
                  - Her latent magic has always been there—controlling the weather, influencing fate—but she suppressed it.
                  - She vowed never to use magic, believing it would only lead to pain.

                  When Sophie vanishes, Jean is forced to step into the world she feared most.
                  She follows a mystical astral line—a connection between mother and daughter—leading her into London’s underground lairs.
                  There, she discovers that Sophie has changed, her aura no longer purely human.

                  But the more she uses magic, the more she risks losing herself to the power she once feared.

                  Mischa is a witch of immense power, feared even by her own kind.

Her speech is often fragmented, but those who spend time with her find her words slowly becoming clearer—as if reality itself bends around her.

                <p>
                  As head of the High Order of Witches, Hailzy commands immense power. Her methods are unconventional, her decisions ruthless, and her goals often shrouded in mystery.

                  When Hailzy loses her temper, the very air around her crackles with energy. She can summon devastating electrical storms, set fire to her surroundings with a thought, and shatter minds with psychic force.

                  Hailzy has long known more about Sophie’s role in the prophecy than she has ever admitted. She does not fear Sophie—but she knows that if the prophecy is fulfilled, even witches may not be safe.
