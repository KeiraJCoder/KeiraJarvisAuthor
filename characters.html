                                        Sophie Munday is a girl caught between two worlds—one she has always known and another she never believed existed. 
                                        Her life has been defined by 
                                        <span class="emphasis">mystery, unanswered questions, and relentless nightmares</span>. 
                                        As she turns <span class="emphasis">16</span>, everything begins to change, forcing her to confront 
                                        <span class="emphasis">a past hidden from her</span>.
                                    </p>
                                </details>

                                    <p>
                                        Sophie was raised by her <span class="emphasis">single mother, Jean</span>, who has always been 
                                        <span class="emphasis">protective to an unusual degree</span>.
                                        She was led to believe that her father was 
                                        <span class="emphasis">a firefighter who died before she could remember him</span>.

                                    <p>
                                        Since childhood, she has suffered from 
                                        <span class="emphasis">terrifying nightmares and strange visions</span>. 
                                        She has always suspected that there is 
                                        <span class="emphasis">more to her past than she has been told</span>, but 
                                        <span class="emphasis">no one will give her answers</span>.

                                        Her <span class="emphasis">blood type is rare</span>, and there are <span class="emphasis">whispers of an ancient prophecy</span> that somehow involves her.

                                        Jean has kept secrets from Sophie for

                                        Their relationship is close, but Jean’s

                                        Eden was once The Master's <span class="emphasis">protégé</span>, trained in his ways 
                                        and raised in his court of terror. He committed

                                        Their <span class="emphasis">whirlwind romance</span> led to Jean’s pregnancy—

                                        Aeryn is introduced in Book One as 
                                        <span class="emphasis">one of Eden’s closest allies</span>. 
                                        She is <span class="emphasis">strong-willed, confident, and dangerous</span>, yet there is a quiet 
                                        intensity to her that suggests <span class="emphasis">deep, hidden wounds</span>. 
                                        While most young Vampyrs are drawn to power, Aeryn has always 
                                        <span class="emphasis">followed her own path</span>, making her 
                                        <span class="emphasis">an enigma even among her kind</span>.

                                        When we first meet her, she is <span class="emphasis">waiting in a graveyard</span>, 
                                        impatient for Eden to arrive. Her playful scolding and familiarity with him 
                                        <span class="emphasis">immediately hint at a long history between them</span>.

                                        Aeryn is the <span class="emphasis">only Vampyr Eden truly trusts</span>. They share an

                                        She <span class="emphasis">teases him</span>, but she also respects him in ways that others do not.

                                        but she sees him differently. When he turns to her for help, she doesn’t hesitate, even though it

                                        After a hunt, Aeryn mistakenly <span class="emphasis">attacks Eden</span>, thinking he is human.

                                His obsession with control blinds him to the crumbling empire beneath his feet.

                                She built an empire of loyal followers, ensuring their dependence by feeding them blood laced with heroin.

Her crimson gown flickers with golden sigils, the hem eternally ablaze. Flames coil around her wrists and fingers, casting radiant embers into the air.

Unlike Seraphyna, he does not radiate fire but instead absorbs surrounding light, making it difficult to look directly at him.

                                    <strong>Seraphyna:</strong> Fire is an extension of her soul, responding to her emotions. She can summon flames at will, burning anything in her path, yet also extinguishing them with a thought. When she loses control, her presence alone can reduce anything to ash.

                                    <strong>Sepherious:</strong> Sepherious bends gravity and absorbs surrounding light. His presence distorts reality, making objects feel heavier. When he reaches for Seraphyna, his form fades into mist, preventing them from ever truly touching.

                                    Seraphyna is shaken by the memories, and for the first time, she questions whether her rage is truly justified. Sepherious, ever the voice of reason, urges her to consider breaking their cycle rather than continuing it.

                                    With Eden granted access to the vaults, Seraphyna and Sepherious face a terrible choice: remain as they are, or sacrifice their physical forms to unlock the truth.

                                    In a final act of defiance against fate, they allow themselves to fade once again, knowing they will forget each other but hoping this time will be different.

                                    Mischa is an unsettling and cryptic presence in the story. Her speech is fragmented and difficult to understand, raising questions about whether she struggles to communicate or if she chooses to speak this way. She often giggles at odd moments and does not react to situations in a conventional manner, making it difficult to determine her true motivations.

                                    Mischa has long, light blonde hair and pale, almost translucent skin. Her sharp features and large, eerie blue eyes give her an ethereal and unsettling look. She moves silently and unnaturally, often appearing and disappearing without warning. In the darkness, she is almost impossible to track.

                                    Mischa is detached from those around her, watching with amusement or indifference as events unfold. She speaks in riddles, rarely giving direct answers, and seems to operate on an understanding of reality different from everyone else. She does not display fear, anger, or sadness in a way that others would recognize, making her intentions and emotions nearly impossible to read.

                                    Mischa meets Aeryn in complete darkness. She introduces herself in a strange, broken way and insists she does not need help. Though Aeryn is initially terrified, Mischa eventually helps her escape by muttering in an unknown language, which somehow causes the chains binding Aeryn to release. Without explanation, Mischa disappears, leaving Aeryn to wonder who—or what—she really is.

                                    Mischa’s abilities are unlike any other magic seen in the story. She does not cast spells in the traditional sense but instead seems able to bend reality to her will. She moves silently, appears and disappears unpredictably, and has knowledge of things that have not yet happened. Whether she is a witch, something older, or something entirely different is never explicitly stated.
