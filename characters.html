                        <h3>Sophie Munday</h3>
                        <p><strong>Full Bio:</strong> Sophie Munday is a 15-year-old schoolgirl on the cusp of turning 16. She has lived her entire life plagued by vivid and terrifying nightmares, waking most nights in tears. The toll of constant sleep deprivation is evident—her blue eyes are shadowed by dark circles, and her thoughts often seem distant, as if she is only half-present in the waking world. She always carries a tattered, well-worn notebook, a place to capture fragments of dreams and thoughts she cannot escape.</p>
                        <p>Despite her quiet and somewhat withdrawn nature, Sophie possesses a deep inner strength. She has no memory of her father and struggles to reconcile the missing pieces of her past with the unsettling feeling that there is more to her nightmares than simple bad dreams. As the story unfolds, she is drawn deeper into a world she never believed existed, where Vampyrs, Witches, and Werewolves are real—and she is at the center of a prophecy that could change everything.</p>

                        <h3>Eden</h3>
                        <p><strong>Full Bio:</strong> Eden is an enigmatic figure, seamlessly blending timelessness with modernity. Originally from East London in a bygone era, his appearance suggests an age in the late 20s to early 30s, yet he possesses an ageless quality. A silent observer, he has watched over Sophie since her infancy, his motives known only to himself.</p>
                        <p>With a balanced yet muscular build, dark wavy hair, and piercing eyes that seem to peer into one's soul, Eden carries an air of quiet authority. His attire is always dark and functional, his long leather coat serving as both a shield and a relic of his past. He moves with the precision of a predator yet harbors a rare depth of emotion that sets him apart from others of his kind.</p>
                        <p>Though hardened by centuries of existence, Eden is not without kindness. He carries a depth of empathy rarely seen among his kind, making him a contradiction—both ruthless and gentle, protector and predator. His reasons for watching over Sophie remain his own, but his presence is unwavering, ensuring she is never truly alone.</p>

        <h3>Aeryn</h3>
        <p><strong>Full Bio:</strong> Aeryn, originally named Elspeth, was born in the 1870s in Bethnal Green, London. Her life was simple, bound by the expectations of a working-class family, until she encountered Eden in 1888. Their meeting changed her life forever, as she was turned into a Vampyr without consent. From that moment, she became an eternal being, forced to navigate a world of darkness she never asked for.</p>

        <p>Despite her immortality, Aeryn remains torn between her Vampyr instincts and the fragments of humanity she clings to. While outwardly youthful, her violet eyes and solemn gaze betray the centuries of loss, conflict, and regret she has endured. She struggles to reconcile the person she was with the predator she has become. Her relationship with Eden is fraught with complexity; she acknowledges him as her creator but harbors resentment over the choice he made for her.</p>

        <p>Aeryn often appears cold and distant, a defense against the pain of forming attachments. However, beneath her guarded exterior lies a being capable of profound love and unwavering loyalty. Her bond with Sophie is more than just obligation—Sophie represents a connection to something greater, a reason to keep fighting. In Sophie, Aeryn sees both danger and hope, a possibility of redemption she never thought possible.</p>

        <h3>Blaine</h3>
        <p><strong>Full Bio:</strong> Blaine, originally known as Richard, was turned into a Vampyr around 170 years ago in Dublin, Ireland. At 19, he was transformed by Faye, and has lived with the consequences of his change ever since. As Blaine, he has wandered through centuries with the weight of his past heavy on his shoulders. Though physically ageless, his mind is burdened by guilt, regret, and the darkness of what he has become.</p>

        <p>Blaine is a man of contradictions: on one hand, he struggles with his inner demons, tormented by his transformation; on the other, he remains a powerful and determined figure, capable of great compassion and immense strength. His past haunts him, but he has learned to navigate the world with quiet resilience.</p>

        <p>Though fiercely independent, Blaine's connection with the prophecy and his ties to Eden have shaped much of his life. His loyalty is often tested, and he walks the line between good and evil, forced to confront his past while seeking redemption.</p>

        <h3>Jean</h3>
        <p><strong>Full Bio:</strong> Jean is Sophie’s mother, who met Eden in 1987 when she was 19 years old at the Ruskin Arms, a Metal/Rock pub and live music venue in East Ham. At the time, she was drawn to him as he stood out with his leather attire and guyliner, a stark contrast to her own "alternative" style. Their brief but intense connection led to Jean’s unexpected pregnancy, and soon after, she learned she was carrying Eden's child, Sophie, a realization that stunned both of them, as Eden believed such a thing was impossible for his kind.</p>

        <p>Jean had no idea Eden was a Vampyr until he finally revealed his true nature. Shocked and hurt, Jean's protective instincts took over, and she banned him from ever seeing his daughter. His presence in their lives became a silent, distant one, watching over Sophie as a guardian while she slept. Despite her emotional turmoil and the confusion about the supernatural forces at play, Jean remained devoted to Sophie, determined to shield her from the hidden truths that had haunted her past.</p>

        <p>Jean's connection to Eden, and the life she built with Sophie, is a complex and troubled one. Though she is a loving mother, her experiences with Eden have left her with scars and unspoken truths that continue to affect her, especially as Sophie grows older and closer to uncovering the mysteries surrounding her origins.</p>

<h3>The Master</h3>
<p><strong>Full Bio:</strong> The Master is a figure from ancient times, his presence chilling and unsettling. With a distorted, pale visage and a sickly aura, he no longer resembles his former self, yet his power remains immense. Though diminished in form, he exerts control over others through fear, manipulation, and coercion.</p>

<p>Known also as *Malus Angelus*, The Master has long sought to maintain his hold on power, even if it means using those closest to him for his own ends. His relationship with Eden, one of his most trusted, is founded on coercion and psychological manipulation. Eden remains close to The Master, not out of loyalty but out of necessity, to protect a child The Master believes could be key to his plans. However, Eden has his own motives, aiming to shield Sophie from The Master's grasp.</p>

<p>The Master's true agenda remains veiled, but it is clear he seeks to use Sophie for his own ends, driven by his desire for control and dominance over the Vampyr world.</p>
